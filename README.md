## System Design

### App Level Architecture

Short backend is built on top of
[Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture](https://api.short-d.com/r/ca), the central
objective of which is separation of concerns.

![Clean Architecture](doc/eng/clean-architecture/clean-architecture.jpg)
![Boundary](doc/eng/clean-architecture/boundary.jpg)

It enables the developers to modify a single component of the system at a time
while leaving the rest unchanged. This minizes the amount of changes have to
be made in order to support new requirements as the system grows. Clean
Architecture also improves the testability of system, which in turn saves
precious time when creating automated tests.

Here is an exmample of finance app using clean architecture:

![Finance App](doc/eng/clean-architecture/finance-app.jpg)

### Service Level Archtecture

Short adopts [Microservices Architecture](https://api.short-d.com/r/ms) to
organize dependent services around business capabilities and to enable
independent deployment of each service.

![Microservice Architecture](doc/eng/microservices.jpg)

### Object Oriented Design

Short leverages class design, package cohesion, and package coupling princiapls
to manage logical dependency between internal components.

#### Class Design

| Principal                                                        | Description                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Single Responsibility Principle](https://api.short-d.com/r/srp) | A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.               |
| [Open Closed Principle](https://api.short-d.com/r/ocp)           | You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it. |
| [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://api.short-d.com/r/lsp)   | Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.          |
| [Interface Segregation Principle](https://api.short-d.com/r/isp) | Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.                 |
| [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://api.short-d.com/r/dip)  | Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.                            |

#### Package Cohesion

| Principal                                                            | Description                                           |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| [Release Reuse Equivalency Principle](https://api.short-d.com/r/rep) | The granule of reuse is the granule of release.       |
| [The Common Closure Principle](https://api.short-d.com/r/ccp)        | Classes that change together are packaged together.   |
| [The Common Reuse Principle](https://api.short-d.com/r/crp)          | Classes that are used together are packaged together. |

#### Package Coupling

| Principal                                                       | Description                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| [Acyclic Dependencies Principle](https://api.short-d.com/r/adp) | The dependency graph of packages must have no cycles. |
| [Stable Dependencies Principle](https://api.short-d.com/r/sdp)  | Depend in the direction of stability.                 |
| [Stable Abstractions Principle](https://api.short-d.com/r/sap)  | Abstractness increases with stability.                |

### Dependency Injection

Short produces flexible and loosely coupled code, by explicitly providing
components with all of the dependencies they need.

```go
type Authenticator struct {
  tokenizer          fw.CryptoTokenizer
  timer              fw.Timer
  tokenValidDuration time.Duration
}

func NewAuthenticator(
  tokenizer fw.CryptoTokenizer,
  timer fw.Timer,
  tokenValidDuration time.Duration,
) Authenticator {
  return Authenticator{
    tokenizer:          tokenizer,
    timer:              timer,
    tokenValidDuration: tokenValidDuration,
  }
}
```

Short also simplifies the management of the big block of order-dependent
initialization code with [Wire](https://api.short-d.com/r/wire), a compile time
depedency injection framework by Google.

```go
func InjectGraphQlService(
  name string,
  sqlDB *sql.DB,
  graphqlPath provider.GraphQlPath,
  secret provider.ReCaptchaSecret,
  jwtSecret provider.JwtSecret,
  bufferSize provider.KeyGenBufferSize,
  kgsRPCConfig provider.KgsRPCConfig,
) (mdservice.Service, error) {
  wire.Build(
    wire.Bind(new(fw.GraphQlAPI), new(graphql.Short)),
    wire.Bind(new(url.Retriever), new(url.RetrieverPersist)),
    wire.Bind(new(url.Creator), new(url.CreatorPersist)),
    wire.Bind(new(repo.UserURLRelation), new(db.UserURLRelationSQL)),
    wire.Bind(new(repo.URL), new(*db.URLSql)),
    wire.Bind(new(keygen.KeyGenerator), new(keygen.Remote)),
    wire.Bind(new(service.KeyFetcher), new(kgs.RPC)),

    observabilitySet,
    authSet,

    mdservice.New,
    provider.NewGraphGophers,
    mdhttp.NewClient,
    mdrequest.NewHTTP,
    mdtimer.NewTimer,

    db.NewURLSql,
    db.NewUserURLRelationSQL,
    provider.NewRemote,
    url.NewRetrieverPersist,
    url.NewCreatorPersist,
    provider.NewKgsRPC,
    provider.NewReCaptchaService,
    requester.NewVerifier,
    graphql.NewShort,
  )
  return mdservice.Service{}, nil
}
```

### Database Modeling

![Entity Relation Diagram](doc/eng/db/er-v1.jpg)

### Feature Toggle

Short employs `feature toggles` to modify system behavior without changing code.
UI components controlled by the feature toggles are created inside a centralized
`UIFactory` in order to avoid having nested `if` `else` statement across the
code base:

```typescript
// UIFactory.tsx
export class UIFactory {
  constructor(
    private featureDecisionService: IFeatureDecisionService
  ) {}

  public createGoogleSignInButton(): ReactElement {
    if (!this.featureDecisionService.includeGoogleSignButton()) {
      return <div />;
    }
    return (
      <GoogleSignInButton
        googleSignInLink={this.authService.googleSignInLink()}
      />
    );
  }

  public createGithubSignInButton(): ReactElement {
    if (!this.featureDecisionService.includeGithubSignButton()) {
      return <div />;
    }
    return (
      <GithubSignInButton
        githubSignInLink={this.authService.githubSignInLink()}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

Short also provides `IFeatureDecisionService` interface, allowing the developers
to switch to dynamic feature toggle backend in the future by simply swapping
the dependency injected.

```typescript
// FeatureDecision.service.ts
export interface IFeatureDecisionService {
  includeGithubSignButton(): boolean;
  includeGoogleSignButton(): boolean;
  includeFacebookSignButton(): boolean;
}
```

```typescript
// StaticConfigDecision.service.ts
import { IFeatureDecisionService } from './FeatureDecision.service';

export class StaticConfigDecisionService implements IFeatureDecisionService {
  includeGithubSignButton(): boolean {
    return false;
  }
  includeGoogleSignButton(): boolean {
    return false;
  }
  includeFacebookSignButton(): boolean {
    return true;
  }
}
```

```typescript
// dep.ts
export function initUIFactory(
  ...
): UIFactory {
  ...
  const staticConfigDecision = new StaticConfigDecisionService();
  ...
  return new UIFactory(
    ...,
    staticConfigDecision
  );
}
```

You can read about the detailed feature toggle design on
[this article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html).

### Search Engine Optimization

In order to improve the quality and quantity of the website's traffic, Short
increases its visibility to web search engines through HTML meta tags.

```html
<!-- ./frontend/public/index.html -->
<title>Short: Free online link shortening service</title>

<!-- Search Engine Optimization -->
<meta name="description"
      content="Short enables people to type less for their favorite web sites">
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
<link href="https://short-d.com" rel="canonical">
```

If you search `short-d.com` on Google, you should see Short shows up as
the first result:

![Google Search Result](doc/seo/google.jpg)

### Social Media Summary Card

#### Facebook & LinkedIn

Short leverages `Open Graph` tags to control what content shows up in
the summary card when the website is shared on Facebook or LinkedIn:

```html
<!-- ./frontend/public/index.html -->
<!-- Open Graph -->
<meta property="og:title" content="Short: Free link shortening service"/>
<meta property="og:description"
      content="Short enables people to type less for their favorite web sites"/>
<meta property="og:image"
      content="https://short-d.com/promo/small-tile.png"/>
<meta property="og:url" content="https://short-d.com"/>
<meta property="og:type" content="website"/>
```

Shared on Facebook:

![Facebook Card](doc/social-media-card/facebook.jpg)

Shared on LinkedIn:

![LinkedIn Card](doc/social-media-card/linkedin.jpg)

#### Twitter

Twitter uses its own meta tags to determine what will show up when
the website is mentioned in a Tweet:

```html
<!-- Twitter -->
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image"/>
<meta name="twitter:site" content="@byliuyang11"/>
<meta name="twitter:title" content="Short: Free link shortening service"/>
<meta name="twitter:description"
      content="Short enables people to type less for their favorite web sites"/>
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://short-d.com/promo/twitter-card.png"/>
```

![Twitter Card](doc/social-media-card/twitter.jpg)

## Testing

### The Importance Of Automation

Short is maintained by a small team of talented software engineers working
at Google, Uber, and Vmware as a side project. The team wants to deliver new
features faster without sacrificing its quality. Testing ever-increasing
amount of features manually soon becomes impossible — unless we want
to spend all our time with manual, repetitive work instead of delivering
working features.

Test automation is the only way forward.

### Testing Strategy

![Test Strategy](doc/testing/test-strategy.png)

Please read [Testing Strategies in a Microservice Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing)
for a detailed introduction on test strategies.

### Unit Testing

A unit test exercises the smallest piece of testable software in the
application to determine whether it behaves as expected.

![Unit Test](doc/testing/unit-test.png)

Run unit tests for backend:

```bash
cd backend
./scripts/unit-test
```

#### Sociable And Solitary

![Two Types of Unit Test](doc/testing/unit-test-two-types.png)

#### The FIRST Principal

- [F]ast: Unit tests should be fast otherwise they will slow down
   development & deployment.
- [I]ndependent: Never ever write tests which depend on other test cases.
- [R]epeatable: A repeatable test is one that produces the same results
   each time you run it.
- [S]elf-validating: There must be no manual interpretation of the results.
- [T]imely/[T]horoughly: Unit tests must be included for every pull request
   of a new feature and cover edge cases, errors, and bad inputs.

#### Test Structure

A automated test method should be composed of 3As: Arrange, Act, and Assert.

- [A]rrange: All the data needed for a test should be arranged as part
  of the test. The data used in a test should not depend on the environment
  in which the test is running.
- [A]ct: Invoke the actual method under test.
- [A]ssert: A test method should test for a single logical outcome.

### Integration Testing

An integration test verifies the communication paths and interactions
between components to detect interface defects.

![Integration Test](doc/testing/integration-test.png)

Run integration tests for backend:

```bash
cd backend
./scripts/integration-test
```

### Component Testing

A component test limits the scope of the exercised software to a portion
of the system under test, manipulating the system through internal code
interfaces and using test doubles to isolate the code under test from
other components.

#### In Process

![Component Test](doc/testing/component-test-in-process.png)

#### Out Of Process

![Component Test](doc/testing/component-test-out-of-process.png)

### Contract Testing

An integration contract test is a test at the boundary of an external
service verifying that it meets the contract expected by a consuming
service.

### End To End Testing

An end-to-end test verifies that a system meets external requirements
and achieves its goals, testing the entire system, from end to end.

### The Test Pyramid

![Test Pyramid](doc/testing/test-pyramid.png)

## Deployment

### Kubernetes

Short leverages [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) to automate deployment, scaling,
and management of containerized microservices.

![Node overview](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5cb72d407cbe2755e581b6de757e0d81760d5b86/a9df9/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/public/images/module_03_nodes.svg)

Short uses [GitOps](https://github.com/byliuyang/gitops) to manage Kubernetes cluster.
![GitOps](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt300387d93dabf50e/blt15812c9fe056ba3b/5ce4448f32fd88a3767ee9a3/download)

### Staging

Merging pull request into master branch on Github will automatically deploy the
changes to [staging](https://staging.short-d.com) environment.

### Production

Merging from `master` branch to `production` branch will automatically
deploy the latest code to the production. This is called continuous
delivery in the DevOps world.

![Continuous Delivery](doc/eng/devops/continuous-delivery.png)

In the future, when there are enough automated tests, we may migrate to
continuous deployment instead.
